# Audio_Player

### This is my first big Project, the Audio Player. Here you can hear .wav files with many settings

To convert wav files: [Here](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav) is the link.<br>
Download the exe easily with [BOX](https://app.box.com/s/e3vrcfopevyhqvhwvq9qicciifytlm08).<br>
Or download the txt with [BOX](https://app.box.com/s/n6za3xyc8pmacclvfslzi28ca4px0ge8)
 
Maybe not so easily because your firewall will block it.

If You download the exe, first the Browser firewallwill blck it.
Click Keep File.

Then system firewall. Also press run.
If You Don't find the keep Button, Cick More Information and then Run anyway
 



Happy Hearing,<br>
