# Audio_Player

### This is my first big Project, the Audio Player. Here you can hear .wav files with many settings

To convert wav files: [Here](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav) is the link.<br>
Download the exe easily with [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RefoHiS5quSudyIYyduFRoyScvkE1_Sk/view?usp=sharing) or even <b>better with [Upload Files](https://ufile.io/cp204pwi)</b>

Happy Hearing,<br>
